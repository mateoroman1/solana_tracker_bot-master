## Solana Wallet Tracker (ARCHIVED)
This project was developed in early 2024 as a means to retrieve real-time transaction notifications for wallets on the Solana blockchain. It is not in development anymore and likely no longer works as expected. 

This utilizes the aiogram library for Telegram integration and SQLite for transaction data storage. It requires an API service for transaction data, which must be specified in order for the polling requests to be made.
